# Beaver Builder PDF.js viewer
This module generates shortcodes for the [PDF.js Viewer plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pdfjs-viewer-shortcode/)

What sets this Module apart is that it uses the WP Media Manager to browse for the PDF file. I created a custom fieldtype for this that is loaded in the plugin.
